    - name: Summary
      value: I'm a passionate PhD Student specializing in Machine Learning, particularly in Federated Learning. I find leveraging uncertainty in machine learning fascinating because it enhances the reliability of learning mechanisms. I have a strong track record in pioneering NLP pipelines for real-world projects, and my research interests encompass Bayesian Inference, Optimization, Federated Learning, Cloud Computing, Privacy-constrained Learning, NLP, and MLOps. I'm committed to advancing the boundaries of machine learning and its practical applications.
