I'm a passionate PhD Student specializing in Machine Learning, particularly in Federated Learning. I find leveraging uncertainty in machine learning fascinating because it enhances the reliability of learning mechanisms. I have a strong track record in pioneering NLP pipelines for real-world projects, and my research interests encompass Bayesian Inference, Optimization, Federated Learning, Cloud Computing, Privacy-constrained Learning, NLP, and MLOps. I'm committed to advancing the boundaries of machine learning and its practical applications.

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
